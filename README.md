The Online Assessment System provides a facility to a candidate to take up online assessments. It also allows the administrator of the system to view relevant reports about candidates and the tests that they have attempted. 

So, this system should support two types of users -> “candidate” and the “admin” 

Below are the functionalities that candidate is enabled with: 

1. Registration 

2. Login & Logout 

3. Home page 

4. Take Tests 

5. View Success/Failure result

1. Login & Logout 

2. View list of all Candidates
